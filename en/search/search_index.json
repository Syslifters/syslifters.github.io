The scope of the specific penetration test is contractually agreed on a case-by-case basis and is limited in time (\"time box\"). The Contractor does not guarantee that all existing security vulnerabilities will actually be uncovered. This is due to the limited time resources available and the penetration testers' limited knowledge of IT infrastructure, software, source code, users, etc. The disclosure of system internals, the provision of test users and the comprehensive cooperation of the client with the contractor increase the efficiency of the penetration test.</p> <p>9.

The client shall ensure that all technical measures to block unwanted emails (SPAM protection, phishing prevention, anti-virus systems, mail security solutions, etc.) are deactivated for the sender addresses to be specified by the client during the execution period.
